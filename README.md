Data used in the paper "A Simple and Robust Approach to Bayesian Modelling of Overdispersed Data" (Environmental and Ecological Statistics, in press as of June 2023).

**Blackgrouse Example (Section 3.1)**
This example involves annual counts of male blackgrouse cocks (_Tetrao tetrix_) in the high eastern region of Belgium, given in Table 1 of Lindsey, J (1999) Response surfaces for overdispersion in the study of the conditions for fish eggs hatching. _Biometrics_ 55(1):149–155

**Flamingo Survival Example (Section 3.2)**
The second example comes from a mark-recapture study to estimate annual adult survival probabilities for a population of The Greater Flamingo (_Phoenicopterus ruber_) in the Camargue region of southern France, and have also been analysed by Lebreton, J-D et al. (1992) Modeling survival and testing biological hypotheses using marked animals: a unified approach with case studies. _Ecological Monographs_ 62(1):67–118
